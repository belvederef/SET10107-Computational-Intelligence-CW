### TODOs
# For good report
- Might replace tanh function with heaviside or step function
- Could try Seeding the Population for faster evolution although pop might converge prematurely
- Check immigration

- mutate only alleles that are not known to improve (e.g. tweak ones for fuel)

### Notes
Simply choosing the best individual during selection can get a fitness of 0.13
Mutation set to 1/p where p is length of chromosome

### Results
- Even just implementing tournament selection (with no crossover and not changing mut and replace) all ships
  from the training set landed, 7/8 from the test set, and 143/180 the go nuts setting. mutRate .5 and mutChange .3
- One point crossover,  mutRate .3 and mutChange .3, 4000 iters, popSize 40. Train and Test land perfectly.
